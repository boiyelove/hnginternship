# hnginternship 5


Welcome, please kindly change your DP then head to the #announcements to take on tasks ahead of you.

Provided are the tasks to advance you to the next stage:

## Task 1:

sign up for GitHub. Create a personal repository. Commit a file. Pull the file. Change stuff. Commit again. Check that you have a profile image set here. If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want. After all is complete, add this icon to your status here: :hatching_chick: by the time we start, all those without the above will not start with us.


## Task 2:

Join the #design-stage1 channel. Use Figma to design yourself a home page. Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you. *Everyone* will need to do this. The mentors will give you feedback on your design, however, I will be the final judge. Till your design is accepted, you cannot start the internship. Pay attention to alignment, colors and other important parts of design.
 
Having any difficulty, don't hesitate to send a DM! to a mentor
